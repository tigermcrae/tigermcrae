# 🧠🛠️ Tiger Macrae

👋 Hi. I’m Tiger.  
I’m getting into **IT hardware, on-site support, and field service**.  
I like **hands-on work**, breaking things (on purpose), and fixing them again.

## 🔧 What I’m focusing on
- 🖥️ Computer hardware setup & troubleshooting  
- 🔌 Real-world IT support (on-site > remote)  
- 🌐 Basic networking (LAN, Wi-Fi, routers, cabling)  
- 🧩 CMS-based website maintenance (from past work)

---

## 🧪 What this GitHub is for
- 🛠️ Learning by doing  
- 🧠 Notes, experiments, and small practical projects  
- 📂 Practice repos (hardware, OS installs, networking, scripts)  
- 📈 Slowly turning the contribution graph from **dry** to **alive**

---

## 🗺️ Background
- 🎓 IT student (Mount Kenya University)  
- 💼 Former intern in an e-commerce environment (CMS + basic IT support)  
- 🚗 Open to on-site and field IT roles

---

## ⚠️ Status
- 🔰 Early stage  
- 📉 Low activity (for now)  
- 📈 Skill-building in progress
